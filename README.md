# kickabot
Literally a bot you can kick around.

Just BTW: There are no commands.

[Add to server](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=947952353292730428&permissions=0&scope=bot)

In case you're wondering why no permissions are requested, it's because it doesn't need permissions! There are no commands.
